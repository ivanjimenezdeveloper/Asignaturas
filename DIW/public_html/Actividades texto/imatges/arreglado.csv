Heading elements provide important benefits: they act as wayfinding cues for in-page navigation, they contribute to page content summaries, and they provide context to the content below them. To do so effectively, headings should follow the `<h1>` to `<h6>` hierarchy and they should not skip levels. Restructure the document's heading order so it uses a clear, ordered, and intuitive hierarchy. Ensure there are no gaps between each numbered heading level and the next.","<body>\n<!-- Contenedor -->\n<div id=""contenedor"">\n\n\t<!-- Cabecera -->\n\t<div id=""cabecera"">\n\t\t<div id=""logo"">\n                    <h1><span style=""visibility: "">LOGOTIPO</span></h1>\n\t\t</div>","402b9a151614d93556ab1f1a135e6fa5","{""top-left"":{""x"":0,""y"":0},""bottom-right"":{""x"":1008,""y"":1385.95},""height"":1385.95,""width"":1008}","/html/body","Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, Level A: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships,Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, Level AAA: 2.4.10 Section Headings","https://tenon.io/bestpractice.php?bpID=143&tID=155"
